# Compose the Largest One-Line Digital Puzzle.

Do you enjoy puzzles? Letâ€™s create a digital puzzle where the connecting elements are the first or last TWO digits. To simplify the task, we'll use a one-line puzzle, where fragments can only be placed one after another.

For example, consider the following strings of numbers:

_608017, 248460, 962282, 994725, 177092_

**Solution:**

By analyzing the ending parts, we can form the following chain:

248460 & 608017 & 177092 -> 2484(**60**)80(**17**)7092

Thus, the largest sequence and the answer will be: **24846080177092**.
